# Bullet-resistant-armor-made-of-polymer-metal-composite
In this project, an attempt to synthesize a composite material to effectively act as a bullet-resistant armor has been made using waste raw materials. Layers of motorcycle tube rubber, reinforced with stainless steel meshes using heatproof adhesive, and one layer of motorcycle tire rubber were first manufactured. This composite has been sandwiched between two steel plates of thickness 3mm, and ballistic testing with a 9mm pistol from close range, with and without the front plate, yielded positive results. A workable design of the same has been proposed.
